# Laundry Rooms

In the basement of the Luthagsesplanaden building you will find the laundry rooms.
> Don't forget to tidy up and clean the laundry room when you are done.
> Always leave the laundry room in the same condition you wouild like to find it in, and never in a worse condition than what you found it in.

## When reserving your slot
The only way to book a laundry slot is by locking your appartments marker in the planning board in the wanted position.
If you miss the marker with the lock, you should contact the technical property manager, *Uppsala Fastighetstjänst*, to order a new.
You are responsible for the marker and you will be charged for a new one.

Running the laundry machines, the tumble dryers, or the dehumidifier in the drying room is only allowed daytime, according to the schedule.
Your neighbors right to have a good nights sleep is the reason for limiting the operating hours.

### Laundry Room No. 1
Laundry room no. 1 is the one furthest away for Luthagseplanaden 10A, only accessible from the 10B stairway.
Reserving gives the right to use the drying room with one hour Bokning av tvättstugan innebär också rätt att samtidigt disponera torkrummet.

When you are done with the laundry, you should move your lockable marker to a new slot, or to a "parking place".
By moving your marker you tell your neigbors you are done and that what remains of the slot can be used by someone else.

> If you reserved a laundry room, and have not started within one hour, another member of the housing association is allowed to use your slot.
